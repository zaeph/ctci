;; Solved in 25'; not very efficient since we have a second loop to it, but
;; the `setf' is working fine for inplace modifications.

;; Time complexity:
;; O(MÃ—(N+1)), with the extra M being for the 2nd loop for wiping cols.

;; Since we need to do a second loop to wipe the columns that have been tagged
;; in the first pass, I think that's pretty good.
