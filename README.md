Hello~.

This repository contains my solutions to the exercises in *Cracking the Coding Interview* (6th ed.).  Most of them are written in Elisp with common libraries and paradigms used by Emacs package maintainers.

My intention was two-fold: prepare for the FAANG interview format, and develop my problem-solving skills to be more efficient at maintaining the packages I develop; the latter is which why I've elected to stick with Elisp, even though it might seem like an obtuse choice for most reviewers.
